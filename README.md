# DefAce
The goal of DefAce is to provide an RPG Maker-like framework to the [Defold Game Engine](https://defold.com/) to make the engine more accessible to users unfamilar with it and to also allow people used to RPG Maker to use a more feature rich engine without having to learn whole new concepts.

The project has only just begun but contributions are welcome nonetheless.
